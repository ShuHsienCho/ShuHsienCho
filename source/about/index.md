## About me

![Photo](/asset/photo/blog.png)



I am Shu-Hsien Cho (卓書賢), a first year Ph.D. student studying Biostatistics at University of Texas MD Anderson UTHealth Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences. Before pursuing this Ph.D. degree, I was a research assistant under the supervision of [Dr. Yen-Tsung Huang](http://www.stat.sinica.edu.tw/personinfo/?sysid=5017880) at [Institute of Statistical Science (ISS), Academia Sinica](http://www.stat.sinica.edu.tw/statnewsite/). I received my Bachelor degree with double major in [Statistics](https://stat.nccu.edu.tw) and [Economics](https://econo.nccu.edu.tw) at [National Chengchi University](https://www.nccu.edu.tw/index.php) in Jan, 2017.

My research interest is survival analysis and clinical trial. In addition, I am also interested in causal mediation analysis, integrative genomic data analysis, and the interaction of survival analysis with other fields. In my research spare time, I am also interested in learning applicable methodologies for baseball data analysis (e.g., bayesian approaches, spatial data, etc.) I also create a [baseball data analysis blog (in Mandarin)](https://shunyubaseball.wordpress.com) with [my friend](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yu-min-chien/?originalSubdomain=tw). 

Outside academics, I love baseball, weight training, and photography. Also, I enjoy cooking, watching sports game, reading sociology and economics books, playing contract bridge and Pokemon VGC, and indie music. In addition to being an outstanding researcher, I hope to keep asking questions and fulfill my curiosity to this world.
